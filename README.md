+‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project is currently under active refactoring.  
+Some parts of the codebase are being restructured for better maintainability (splitting algorithms, model, and UI).

+This project is a **PCB drilling path optimizer** that uses different algorithms for the [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).  


This project is a **PCB drilling path optimizer** that uses different algorithms for the [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).  
The tool reads **EAGLE `.brd` files**, extracts drill hole coordinates, and computes an efficient path for the CNC drill head.

It comes with a simple **Qt GUI** (using [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com/)) to visualize the points and the computed drilling path.

## ‚ú® Features
- Load drill hole coordinates from **Eagle `.brd` files**
- Multiple TSP algorithms implemented:
  - **NP** ‚Äì Natural permutation (baseline order)
  - **NN** ‚Äì Nearest Neighbor
  - **SA** ‚Äì Simulated Annealing
  - **2-opt** ‚Äì Local optimization
- Interactive **plot visualization** of points and optimized paths
- Progress bar and optional step-by-step animation (for 2-opt and SA)
- Save results (ordered drilling coordinates) to a text file

## üöÄ Usage
1. Start the application.
2. Load a `.brd` file using **Load** button.
3. Select an algorithm from the **Algorithm dropdown**:
   - NP, NN, SA, or 2-opt.
4. Click **Start** to compute the path.
5. Visualize the result in the plot.
6. Save the computed path to a text file.
